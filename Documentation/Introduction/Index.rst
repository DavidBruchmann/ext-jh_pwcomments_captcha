What does it do?
================

This extension adds a captcha to the pwComments comment-form to prevent from spam and/or bot-comments. Actually the captcha extension “sr\_freecap” are supported.

.. warning::

	Captcha extension "captcha" has been supported, but since version 0.1.0 of this extension, support is deprecated, because it seems that the required extension "captcha\_viewhelper" is not maintained anymore.
